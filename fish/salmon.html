        <p>
            Salmon is one of Neptune's greatest creations. Sure, whales are majestic and 
            sharks are cool as heck, but at the end of the day they contribute nothing 
            to your diet (probably) and all you can do is admire them from a distance. 
            Salmon, on the other hand, will work <i>wonders</i> for your diet due to 
            its plentiful macro- and micro-nutrients, most notably omega-3 fatty acids, 
            which are especially important for the typical Western diet.
